          | #[strong Software Process Mining and AI-Driven Software Engineering:]
          | Automated collection, descriptive and predictive analysis, and
          | visualization of data about software systems, their evolution and the
          | development team based on software process mining and software visualization.
          | The objective is to provide tools that contribute to transform software engineering
          | into a real engineering discipline. As key technology, AI-based methods are applied
          | to high-dimensional information spaces that reflect state and dynamics of software development projects and processes.

          | #[strong Geospatial Analysis, Geovisualization &amp; Geospatial AI:]
          | Segmentation, classification, semantic interpretation, 3D reconstruction,
          | and real-time visualization of 3D geospatial data, in particular, 3D point clouds.
          | The goal is to enable the creation of geospatial digital twins based on sensored or modeled
          | spatial data. Geospatial AI as arising scientific discipline combines technologies in spatial science,
          | artificial intelligence, data mining, data visualzation and high-performance computing to extract knowledge from spatial big data.
        li.list-group-item
          | #[strong Sensor Analytics &amp; Sensor AI:]
          | Extraction, fusion, predictive analysis, and visualization of real-time sensor data,
          | in particular, in the fields of technical plant operations and domotic systems.
          | The goal is to provide foundations for technical digital twins of complex machinery and industrial plants.
        li.list-group-item
          | #[strong Visual Media:]
          | Processing, semantic interpretation, transformation as well as stylized and abstract visualization
          | of visual media content, digital images, and videos based on AI, in particular, neural networks,
          | deep learning, and computer graphics. The objective is to investigate innovative digital tools to
          | create, transform, abstract, and stylize visual media contents.
        li.list-group-item
          | #[strong Information Visualization &amp; Information Cartography:]
          | Methods and techniques to visualize large-scale hierarchical and non-hierarchical abstract data and
          | geographic data by means of 3D information metaphors such as tree maps, topic maps, and information landscapes.
        li.list-group-item
          | #[strong Real-Time 3D Rendering &amp; Non-Photorealistic Rendering:]
          | GPU-affine algorithms and techniques for visualizing complex 3D geometric models,
          | web-based 3D applications, and service-oriented 3D rendering.
